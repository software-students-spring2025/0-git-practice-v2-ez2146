# DeepSeek: The Chinese AI app that has the world talking
What I find most interesting about this article is how DeepSeek has disrupted both the AI industry and financial markets despite being developed with significantly fewer resources than American competitors like ChatGPT and Claude. Its ability to achieve cutting-edge performance at a fraction of the cost challenges the assumption that only companies with access to the most advanced chips and massive budgets can compete at the highest level. The impact on Nvidia’s stock price, wiping out $600 billion in market value in a single day, underscores how disruptive this breakthrough is. I also think that DeepSeek’s rise highlights the geopolitical stakes of AI development, as it signals China’s ability to innovate independently despite U.S. restrictions on advanced chip exports. This not only shakes up the AI landscape but also raises broader questions about global tech competition, innovation efficiency, and the future of U.S.-China technological rivalry.

I have seen this logo but wasn't sure what it was so thank you for teaching me!

It is facinating to see the development of AI. ChatGPT always seemed like the tip of the iceberg and to see DeepSeek be as powerful with less resource makes me think AI has more innovation. One thing this article does is higlight Chinese tech innovation while calling to action. For example, the statement "Their surprise stems from seeing a Chinese company join their game as an innovator, not just a follower" underscore the global AI shift.
